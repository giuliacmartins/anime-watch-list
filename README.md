# Anime Watch List Project

Simple webpage using lists, dropdowns, text box, and false submit button. This Project was the set up to the USF Independent Study Project, and to get an idea of what I can improve and incorporate.

***INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO OPEN THE ZIP FILES***

Once you click on one the zip files it would lead you to the next page. It would show a link called "view raw," once you click that link, the zip file will be downloaded.

When you click on the file for the folder, you can view any of the HTML files that are in the folder. (I would recommend clicking the ones that say index.html since it is the first webpage page :) but if there is only one HTML file, just click on that :))
